# Mappings file for document type and issuing party normalization
#
# This file stores raw → canonical mappings to ensure deterministic normalization.
# Once a raw value has been mapped, it will always map to the same canonical.
#
# Structure:
#   - confirmed: User-validated mappings (trusted)
#   - auto: Auto-added by LLM (pending review via 'review_mappings' command)
#   - canonicals: Master list of valid canonical values
#
# Copy this file to config/mappings.yaml and customize as needed.
# The actual mappings.yaml is gitignored as it may contain personal vendor names.
