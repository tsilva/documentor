# Hash cache for content-based deduplication
#
# This file caches file_hash -> content_hash mappings to avoid expensive
# content-based hash recomputation. Content hashing renders all PDF pages
# at 150 DPI and hashes the pixel data, which is slow (~1-2s per file).
#
# The fast file hash (SHA256 of raw bytes) is used as the cache key.
# Since identical file bytes always produce the same content hash,
# this cache is always valid.
#
# Benefits:
#   - Cold cache: ~4-8x faster (parallelization across CPU cores)
#   - Warm cache: ~50-100x faster (only fast hashing needed)
#
# Copy this file to config/hash_cache.yaml to get started.
# The actual hash_cache.yaml is gitignored as it is auto-generated.

# Cache entries: file_hash -> content_hash
cache:
  # Example entries (8-char SHA256 prefixes):
  # a1b2c3d4: e5f6g7h8
  # b2c3d4e5: f6g7h8i9
