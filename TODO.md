- Softcode enums, load them from JSON
- Add ability to rename files based on their metadata (enables bulk manual fixes)
- Add CSV export feature
- Add ability to run validation checks (eg: is this kind of files available every month?)
- Make sure hashes are also in metadata (requires patching previous runs)
- Make loading of hash index use metadata hashes instead
